# Bye Bye Hello World
These are the Dyalog APL shell scripts developed in the [Bye Bye Hello Dyalog APL video](https://youtu.be/9IFx1ZT7XW8) which is a reaction to proglangcast's [Bye Bye Hello APL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xdzez9L5iM).

Each of the following directories has a `Run.apls` script:

| Directory | Description
|---|---
| [ctrl-struct-tradfns](ctrl-struct-tradfns/Run.apls) | Tradfns using control structures, even when not really necessary
| [balanced-tradfns](balanced-tradfns/Run.apls) | Tradfns using Compress and an inline dfn instead of small control structures
| [dfns](dfns/Run.apls) | Dfns using tail recursion instead of a while loop
| [one-liner](one-liner/Run.apls) | A merger of the dfns into a single line of code â€” don't do this for production code!
